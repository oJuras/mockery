# mockery
From a clock system made usings matrices (for no actual practical reason) to a useless "cryptography" system, they're all created as internal jokes and serves no real-world purpose. This is not supposed to be taken seriously by any means and all the names involved are fictitious.

Most things here were made in less than twenty minutes and may have some bugs. I do not intend to fix nor upgrade any of them.
